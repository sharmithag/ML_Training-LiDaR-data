# ML_Training-LiDAR-data  
This project is done as a apart of ENPM808A Machine Learning course.  
Data collected from a car like robot (mobile robot) with LiDAR driven in open and corridor environments is trained and tested to predict future action commands.   
The data is trained using LINEAR REGRESSION and also using NEURAL NETWORKS for a performance comparison.  
An overview of the project is given in ML_ppt. A detailed description is given in ML_report.  
The drive link for the data is given in the final project question pdf.
