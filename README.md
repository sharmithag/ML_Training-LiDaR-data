## Approach

Data collected from a car like robot (mobile robot) with LiDAR driven in open and corridor environments is trained and tested to predict future action commands.
The data is trained using LINEAR REGRESSION and also using NEURAL NETWORKS for a performance comparison.  

## Datasets used

The drive link has the training and testing datasets. From the given data, training data,test data and validation data is taken and used to run the code.
